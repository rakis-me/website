      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Rakis, I am a passionate web developer, that enjoys teaching how to program. Learning to code is not easy, but it does not have to be a chore either.</p>
      <p>I learned to code at a very young age, but that does not mean that you have to follow the same path I did, you can learn anything 
        at any time in life. It does take time, but you don't have to spend all of the time in one season. If you are interested in learning to
        code spend some time on my site, I am sure you will learn something.
      </p>
      <h2>Why learn to code?</h2>
      <p>With code, you can: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communicate with the world</li>
        <li>Build applications</li>
        <li>Provide value</li>
        <li>Create</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to learn to code?</h2>
      <p>There are many ways to learn, but it does not have to complex. Here is a path I recommend:</p>
      <h3>Learn</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> a little HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>the command line</li>
        <li>about networking and servers part 1 serve your webpage</li>
        <li>programming basics with Javascript</li>
        <li>about networking part 2, APIs</li>
        <li>to use data and storage</li>
        <li>to build applications</li>
        <li>authentication</li>
        <li>security</li>
        <li>to learn</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These topics should get you started but remember this journey is never ending, so you will always need to learn to learn. 
        You can find many resources about these topics online and you should connect to as many as possible. My goal is to keep things
      simple, no certificates, no logins, no fancy graphics or animations. If you need to gamify your learning or need faux motivation
      you can find it else where.</p>
      <p>
        I may start to do some videos of the workshops, but most of material will be pure text. Keep it simple! You will find when you 
        remove all the blinking lights, you see the fundamentals and once you understand the fundamentals then you can create anything!
      </p>
      <h2>It takes a village</h2>
      <p>You don't have to learn alone, and I do not have to teach alone, if you agree with this approach and methodology, and would like
        to contribute, here is how you can get started. By the way as you learn, a great way to re-enforce you learning is to teach.
